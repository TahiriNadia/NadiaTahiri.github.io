	<h3>Gergana Daskalova</h3>
	<p>I am a global change ecologist with a passion for biodiversity change, agro-ecology and quantitative syntheses. The overarching aim of my research is to determine what are the sources of the complex patterns of population and biodiversity change observed over time around the world. From forest cover change around the world to climate warming in the Arctic and more, I am investigating how and why Earthâ€™s biota is changing across the Anthropocene. In the last five years, Coding Club has brought me so much joy and I have loved creating tutorials, running workshops and seeing our team grow.
